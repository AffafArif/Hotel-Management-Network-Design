# Hotel Management Network Design




## Project Overview

The Hotel network design project aims to create a robust, scalable, and efficient hierarchical network infrastructure for a three-floor hotel, ensuring seamless connectivity, security, and ease of management. Each floor represents distinct departmental divisions, connected through VLANs with inter-VLAN routing enabled. The design employs routers for each floor, connected via serial DCE cables, and uses OSPF for dynamic routing. DHCP servers are configured for automated IP assignment, while SSH is enabled for secure remote router management. The project also integrates port security for enhanced security measures and Wi-Fi networks for mobile connectivity. Cisco Packet Tracer is used to simulate, implement, and verify the design. The project aligns with key networking principles, meeting organizational needs for scalability, performance, and security.

## Devices Used

Routers: Cisco ISR series for routing between VLANs and WAN connectivity.

Switches: Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches for efficient LAN operations.

Access Points: For providing wireless connectivity to guests and staff.

End Devices: Laptops, Desktops, Printers, Phones, and Tablets.
